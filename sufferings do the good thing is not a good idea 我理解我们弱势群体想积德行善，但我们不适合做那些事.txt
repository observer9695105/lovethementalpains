一是"慈善欺诈"客观存在，这是对我们的害。

One is "mercy scam" , it is exist objectly, this is the harm to us. 


一就是因为我们的病ku状态，一旦轻微的利益了别人之后，可能构成法律上可知的 “剥削式的无因管理”。就是说从法制角度存在着现实的“人情债”，我们是个“无底洞”。

One is because of our sick conditon. Once we lightly benefit others, it will form a kind of lawful thing called "voluntary service". That is to say if we do good things to the society , the benefits will have the "emotional burden debt" to us(moral & law like) & we are a "black hole". 

一就是我们所在的社会阶层的价值&权柄、知识和智慧储备等等，不足以有效解决问题。

One is in our social level, our value & rights 、knowledge & wisdom etc , can't support us from solved the problems.

你想做好事得到慈善的福报 & 做对别人有利益的事情。

You want do good things to get moral interest back or treat others nice & good to them.

但本质上不会是这样的。

But natually won't be like this.

请理解这一点。

Please understand this point.
