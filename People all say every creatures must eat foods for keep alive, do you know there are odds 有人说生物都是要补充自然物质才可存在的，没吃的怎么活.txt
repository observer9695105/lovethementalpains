但你还别说，还真有没吃的能活的生物，就是比如饿鬼道的众生。因为大家都会说人话有一定天赋道德。所以我们不理解下层生物的痛ku。比如猫狗脑子里并没有什么伦理道德。它们不知道什么naco。你看我们生气了还在说理和博弈。动物一看自己比如一个吃的让给占了。就会咬它们。所以我们才NX。不管我们认为反naco的是善良的还是邪恶的。我们是道德的。也就是占据利益的生物层居于者。

But you don't know,there is really the creatures without eating can be alive. Say "eager ghost tao's creatures". Coz we all can say human's languages. That means we all have the tao-given-moral as for our human.So we merely understand the liveing of others under level creatures. Say the cats & dogs have no much moral concept. They even don't know what is the "mind control".When we angery , we will type words up to the net. But when the animals have seen other animals eat more, they will bite them. So we human are actually rulling kind. Not to say about if the anti-mind-control is kind or wicked. We are moral creatures. That means our owning is better than the other creatures.
