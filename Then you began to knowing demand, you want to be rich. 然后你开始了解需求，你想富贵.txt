然后诈骗贼这时候就来偷你。于是你可能被偷，也可能会产生反扒善缘。如果你产生反扒善缘。你就不会继续抱怨&不满自己的待遇了，，所以我就是这么轻信佛教的。因为我发现我在求于私利的时候人们总是瞧不起我。我感觉很痛苦难受也没有朋友。那时候如果有人赞同支持我吧。就发现都是不好的人。比如FD分子一类的。我就感觉实际上是我滋扰了别人。在大象身体不行了之后，它们就会去到一个大象坟场，自己在那死掉，不会让同伴伤心。大象的记忆力是相当好的。比如在？？年一格人欺负了象，象就会报复那个人。

At that time the theif is going to steal you . Then you can be stolen, maybe you can have the anti-steal good karma. If you have the anti-steal good karma, you won't keeping complain & not-satisfied your life. So that is how I believe in buddha lightly. Coz I found out when I am in pursue self interests, people all look down upon me. I feel very pain & suffering & no friends. Then if someone supporting me at that time. I found out those are not good people. You know when the elephants are weak, they will go to an elephant-tome. Then they will die there solely & quitely without the painful feelings from any of the other co-elephants. The memory of the elephants are very good. Say if decades ago, I hurt an elephant, it will revenge to me now.
